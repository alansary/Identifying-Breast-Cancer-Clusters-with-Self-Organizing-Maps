# Identifying Breast Cancer Clusters with Self-Organizing Maps

## Overview
The dataset comes with sklearn and consists of physical properties of labeled malignant and benign tumors. The purpose of this notebook is to find meaning from the data by using Self-Organizing Maps to isolate the tumors into separate clusters.
